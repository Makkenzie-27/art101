		<h1>Makkenzie Zepeda</h1>
		<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
			<p>Graphic designer / playable media artist with a focus in games and film.
				Inspired to become an artist at a young age by studying street art. I grew
				up in downtown LA where I would walk the streets of the art district. The
				large buildings covered in art made me feel connected to the world.
				My entire life has been around art. From knowing musicians / producers,
			 	museum curators, film directos, and those who could only speak through the
			 	murals. My parents even collected art from JAJA Gabor, Shepard Fairy,
				and classic renaissance artists. I greatly enjoy studying all art form styles.
				Focusing on the waves of emotions they send through me, and then trying
				to understand what other viewers must feel. The emotional appeal people
				experience when looking at art forms is my drive to create more art
				that can now connect to the world.</p>
