      <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
        <p id="header">
          Working with your partner, create a function that depends on conditionals.
        </p>

      <h2>Challenges:</h2>
        <p>
					There were no real challenges with this assignment. Lab 12 was easier
					than lab 11 in a sense of understadning the task. I felt like the only
					challenge lab 12 presented was corrdinating a time to work with my partner.
					We both are starting to become busier with the group project, outside
					school responsibilities, and other class work. One challenge I personally
					faced was getting the description text to work. I added it in my js file
					but was not sure how to print it. My partner helped me remember to add
					'+' signs at the end of my comments so it read as a string. I still struggle
					with understanding the difference with getting things to print in HTML
					vs JS.
        </p>


      <h2>Problems:</h2>
        <p>
					No real problems. It was mainly going back and forth from the local homepage
					to the code. Fixing only two bugs that presented themselves, due to my
					name calling from html into js and the description code. No major errors.
  			</p>

      <h2>Results:</h2>
        <p>
					Before the bonus task my code allowed a user to input their name and
					it would successfully print out which house their name is affiliated with.
					With the bonus task working, you will see below my input function working
					correctly. A user can input their full name, hit submit, and their name
					will be placed in a house. A short description of that house will also
					print. I have also included a link to the site where I found my descriptions.
					At the very botton of the page is a link to the main homepage as well.
