        <p>My partner Lee and I actually knew eachother before this class. We have
			never met in person before but worked both as artists on a game called
			After School Care in ARTG 171 together. We ended up being partners in Lab
			1 by chance and were super excited to meet one another in a different class
			with somewhat a similar understanding of what the others skills sets were.
			We realized we work very well together. </p>
