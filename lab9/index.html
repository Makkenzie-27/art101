    		<p id="paragraph01">
					For this lab there were some challenges getting certain elements like
					fonts to show up while editing in styles in the js file. Another challenge
					I faced was getting the background color to change. At first the box
					colors were changing easily but when I would change the background color
					for the body itself, the border would only change.
    		</p>

    	<h2 id="problems"> Problems: </h2>
    		<p id="paragraph02">
					For the font issue, at I had to figure out how to call the font and not
					call the font styles from the site.css. I had to go back and change all the
					fonts using DOM commands in my js file. For the background color at
					first the box colors were changing easily but when I would change the
					background color for the body itself, the border would only change.
    		</p>

    	<h2 id="results"> Results: </h2>
    		<p id="paragraph03">
					I was able to call only my lab.css file and get the background color to
					change. I was able to edit the fonts and learn how to use differnt DOM
					calls. Below you can see some examples of me changing the background color,
					font sizes, and showing the text that is in my JS file.
