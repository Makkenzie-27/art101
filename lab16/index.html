      <h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>
        <p id="header">
          Working with your partner, experiment with processing JSON from an API.
        </p>

      <h2>Challenges:</h2>
        <p>
					This lab was very confusing. Only because we knew we had the correct
					code and when checking the console we could not find any major errors.
					The challenging part was figuring out why our endpoint was not working
					and why the page itself was being blocked even with the extension Wes
					provided for getting past CORE blocks. We kept turning the extensions on
					and off. We understood how to do lab 15 after reviewing, so we were not
					sure why we could not get this lab to work.
        </p>


      <h2>Problems:</h2>
        <p>
					My partner and I ran into a problem of not being able to figure out
					how to get the comic site to no longer being blocked. We felt like no
					matter what we tried nothing would work. We knew our objects were being
					called properly and that our endpoint was correct. However, the CORE
					block was the  main problem we faced. Even during the lecture we still
					were unsure why our code was not showing on our page.
        </p>

      <h2>Results:</h2>
        <p>
					We were finally able to complete the assignment after we discovered
					another way google chrome makes sure you have an extension working. We
					finally got the core extension to work and magically the API finally Worked
					as well.
