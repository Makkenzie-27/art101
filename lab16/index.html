      <h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>
        <p id="header">
          Working with your partner, experiment with processing JSON from an API.
        </p>

      <h2>Challenges:</h2>
        <p>
					This lab was very confusing. The examples given with the website we
					had to also work with did not work. Figuring out how to get the API to
					work was challenging. When applying differnt endpoints in the JS for the
					website we were supposed to work with, nothing was able to print due to the site
					itself being blocked. My partner and I also installed the extensions
					Wes suggested and that still did not work. API's alone are still a challenge.

        </p>


      <h2>Problems:</h2>
        <p>
					My partner and I ran into a problem of not being able to figure out
					how to get the comic site to no longer being blocked. We felt like no
					matter what we tried nothing would work.
        </p>

      <h2>Results:</h2>
        <p>
					We were not able to complete the assignment but will be asking for help
					during the next lecture. My failure message prints out due to the site
					being blocked.
