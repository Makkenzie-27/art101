					With a partner, use your debugging knowledge to fix old assignments.

      <h2>Challenges:</h2>
        <p>
          Even though this was a really nice opportunity to let people improve their past
        work, my partner and I actually work pretty well together and didn't think that we needed
        to improve our past projects.
        </p>


      <h2>Problems:</h2>
        <p>
          My partner and I are also struggling with our groups. We aren't getting
        as much cooperation as we woudld. For example we both are the only ones to really turn in any work
        for the website itself and have been programming the entire project alone. That is why we
        have decided to take time each week to not only work on our labs but to also work on our projects.
        We decided to take this weekend as one of those times to work on our projects and hope that is ok. 
  			</p>

      <h2>Results:</h2>
        <p>
          Previous to this lab, my partner and I have worked very well together.
          We have always taken our time to understand, study, and problem solve
          any issues we faced. Resulting in us submitting working / complete labs.
          Through the process of us doing each lab we always make sure to debug and
          work with any syntax errors we find. We have essentially been doing lab 14
          from the getco. We have been recieving full credit for the labs and did not
          know what to fix for lab 14 since our labs 1-13 are working. We decided to reach
          out to our TA and ask what we can do to make sure we also are contributing
          to lab 14. We were given a suggestion to write a short description explaining
          that we did not have any labs that are broken or that we felt needed to be
          re-done. Together as a team we then decided to still create the lab 14 folder
          within Atom and type out our description here. During the weekend we
          worked together on our individual assignments for the group project. Problem
          solving together to make sure we both were still on track while being a helpful
          friend.
