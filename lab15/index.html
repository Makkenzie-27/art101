      <h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
        <p id="header">
          Working with your partner, experiment with jQuery and AJAX.
        </p>

      <h2>Challenges:</h2>
        <p>
					Some challenges I faced, was understanding exactly how to tell if the code
					with the API was corrent or not. When recieving the same ouput every single time
					with no errors, I was unsure if the API was working correctly. I feel like
					the example given by Wes was helpful but also a bit confusing. I was unsure
					how to take my code further. Another challenge faced was finding time to
					work on this lab. I had other priorities with the group project to finish,
					other meetings / homework to do for my graduation course, and work. My
					partner and I both are really wanting to continue the process of turning
					in good clear work.
        </p>


      <h2>Problems:</h2>
        <p>
					Some problems I faced was getting the output to display a different function.
					Rather than always resulting in the failuer function, I would have liked
					to see the API work.
        </p>

      <h2>Results:</h2>
        <p>
					Was able to understand a little more on how to get the AJAX to work.
					The output still displays the failure function only.
