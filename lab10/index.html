    <h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
      <p id="header">
        Working with your partner, experiment with JS events.
      </p>

    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
      <p>
				Some challenges I faced were understanding how form was ussed to
				connect the input text to the button which would return the output.
				I understood the way the code calls to the id and prints out the text.
				But the code was printing my names in the browser rather than in the
				ouput. I originally wanted to copy the js code from lab 7 to output all
				the name breakdowns however was struggling to do so.

      </p>

    <h2> Problems: </h2>
      <p>
				My partner and I worked on trying to get my idea for using lab 7 to work.
				However, we realized the functions required for form and random functions
				was not the way to apprach it.
      </p>

    <h2> Results: </h2>
      <p>
				In the end we used the important parts from lab 7 to sort the name entered
				in the input and print it out properly. I was also able to understand better
				how form is used to collect user input.
      </p>
