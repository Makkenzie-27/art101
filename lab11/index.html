						This assignment was fairly easy. Once again it was a matter of
						time and availiablity between my partner and I as personal matters
						came up and with other class responsibilities. One challenge we did
						face was understanding where to create the buttons. We were confused
						on if the buttons should be created in the Html or JS file.

        <h2>Problems:</h2>
          <p>
						More of the problems was figuring out the css style and adding features
						to the buttons that we wanted. We were able to figure it out after some
						research and debugging. Anoter problem I faced was when I added a
						paragraph to my div id="homepage", I was unable to get rid of the
						text decoration underline feature. Even though I assigned an id to
						the paragraph itself.

						We went back to the lecture notes to better understand placements of
						buttons with jQuery. We were able to successfuly create the buttons
						and add a toggleClass to change the colors of the buttons with a hover
						feature and also change the colors of the text boxes.
