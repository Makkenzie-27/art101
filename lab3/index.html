	<h1> Lab 3 File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
	<p> The main idea of this lab is to further enhance our understandings of what
		we have already learned about HTML to create a local file structure on our
		computer. Along with idex.html files and uploading it all to the server.
	</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> It was hard at first understanding how padding and margins worked. I knew
		I wanted even boarders around different sections of the website but was not
		sure how that worked. After studying some examples on W3 schools and inspecting
		the professors website it became easier. Then I was able to use what I already
		knew with css to create the designs I liked. W3 schools really helped. It was
		easy understanding the file structures because I have to already work with
		file paths and file structures for my major.
	</p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p> Was able to create the index.html file and design a website I like plus
		here is my file structure.</p>
