  		<h2> Challenges: </h2>
  			<p>
          For this lab there were not many challenges while setting up the functions
          and arrays. Previwing everything in the console log to make sure it was
          working properly helped to follow along. The only challenge my partner
          and I did face, was getting the X bonus to work. We both did research
          and attempted the task, we understood the code Professor Wes was telling
          us to do, it was a matter of figuring out how to implement it. We figured
          out our issues in class and re did the X bonus.
        </p>

  		<h2> Problems: </h2>
  			<p>
          Besides struggling with the X bonus task, the rest of the assigment was
          easier for us to complete together.

  		<h2> Results </h2>

          We got our console log to work. The layout of the website is compelte
          and designed how I liked it. There is a task bar on the bottom of the page
          that allows you to go back to the home page. Below are my X bonus task
          results.
