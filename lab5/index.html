		<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
		<p> Working with a partner, we had to practice experimenting with basic
				JavaScript data types and variables.
		</p>
		<h2> Challenges: </h2>
		<p> One challenge I faced was getting use to not being able to delete a line
			of code within the JavaScript Console. It was frustrating having my mistakes
			still visible before my correct line of code. It began to look messy. Besides
			that there were no major issues or challenges.
		</p>
		<h2> Problems: </h2>
		<p> There were no problems really faced. My partner was patient with me
			and we worked side by side making sure the other did not  miss anything.
		</p>
		<h2> Results: </h2>
		<p> I got more practice on how to properly type out code in the JavaScript
			Console. Along with getting familiar with shortcuts.
