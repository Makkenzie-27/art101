      <h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
        <p id="header">
					Working with your partner, experiment with loops.
        </p>

      <h2>Challenges:</h2>
        <p>
					Some challenges I personally faced was debugging and following along
					with the amount of variables we had to input. There was a point where
					I was getting really lost in the JS so I had to write down exactly how many
					variables I had and what I hadn't put in yet. It was more messy than
					practical. Cleaning it up and applying the proper calls was a challenge.
					Understanding the Javascript as always is a little challenging for me. I am
					lucky to have a partner who is patient and helps me understand it better.
					Another challenge I faced was understanding how to change the output to
					print out what I inputed in the table.
        </p>


      <h2>Problems:</h2>
        <p>
					When it came to my challenge of having the input be diaplyed in the output,
					my partner helped me see that my variables were still calling on
					Fizz Buzz Boom rather than the input text itself. I was able to fix it.
  			</p>

      <h2>Results:</h2>
        <p>
					My table below accepts inputs. The output will properly print out the
					text inputed and will place it where the user tells it to go. There are
					zero errors and it looks nice. I like the numbers being next to the word
					because it is a visual showcase of the text working with the number input. 
        </p>
