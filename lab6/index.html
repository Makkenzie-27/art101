			<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<p> Working with a partner, we had to practice experimenting with basic
					JavaScript arrays and objects.
			</p>
			<h2> Challenges: </h2>
			<p>
				One challenge I faced was getting the script output to appear in my
				the browser. The code was similar to the example, so was not sure what
				the real issue was. My main ride text was also appearing on the same line
				as my transportation text, so my partner helped me add a break in the
				proper location.
			</p>
			<h2> Problems: </h2>
			<p>
				Realized I forgot the t in one of my document.writeln.
			</p>
			<h2> Results: </h2>
			<p>
				Everything is working and printing properly. Once I added the "t" in
				document.writeln, my text appeared in the browser. Everything else in the
				tasks were easy to follow along with and get done.
