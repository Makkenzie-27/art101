    <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
    <p> Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and
        manipulate a string. 
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
    <p>Some challenges I faced were understanding how functions worked properly.
			I couldn't grasp the idea of how to set parameters to the same function names.
			For example why setting a function a parameter in the output also worked with
			the same function name but with a differnt paramter. It took me some practice
			understanding how that could make things easier and the order of things
			being called.
    </p>

    <h2> Problems: </h2>
    <p>
			There were some problems of my code not printing in my browser when I was
			creating the splitArray. I was typing like I was in HTML rather than in JS.
			I was using console.log rather than document.writeln. I also had an issue where
			my text was on two differnt lines and it was no longer a comment.
    </p>

    <h2> Results: </h2>
    <p>
			I fixed the issue with the console.log by replacing it with document.writeln.
			The second issue was fixed by putting the text back on the same line and taking
			away the semicolons. I was also able to better understand the way functions call
			arrays better by my partner better explaining it to me and showing me examples.
			She helped me see the way the function and variables were working together step
			by step.
